## About The Project

The Minecraft AFK Console Client was developed due to the lack of a Console Client with an intuitive user interface. Most Minecraft players are casual or non-technical, unfortunately most clients require technical knowledge and time to set up. That's why we made the client. It's intuitive and fast.

Minecraft takes up a lot of your resources, so running the AFK Console Client instead will save you a lot of resources and allow you to AFK with a lot of accounts simultaneously. Furthermore, the client offers a single interface for controlling all of your accounts at once.

As requested, we've also made a web/cloud based client which also allows you to AFK 24/7 with your computer closed. You can check that out [here](https://minecraftafk.com/web) or read more about it just below.

## Want to AFK with your computer turned off?

We also offer a web/cloud version of this client. You can check it out [here](https://minecraftafk.com/web).

The web version is web based, so it runs in any web-browser allowing you to manage your accounts from any device including your phone.

The web client takes allows you to AFK 24/7 from our machines, so you don't wear down your own hardware or pay the high electricity bills. Perfect for competitive players!
